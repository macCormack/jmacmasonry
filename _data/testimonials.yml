They have provided us with reliable skills, quality workmanship and timely completion of work.

  content: I was wanting to thank Jamie for a great job tuck pointing my house. His business approach was both professional and courteous. His on site estimate was helpful to me as he clearly explained the work to be done, the estimate he provided was also very fair compared to other masonry companies. He showed up on time to do the work and he finished when he said he would. The quality of work was exceptional and he left my property in a clean and tidy manner. I will definitely recommend JMac Masonry to my friends and relatives.

  content: We are very happy with the work done by JMac Masonry. We had several masonry problems and Jamie and Nathan fixed them all to our complete satisfaction. This included replacing damaged bricks, filling in small cracks, replacing worn out mortar, putting new support for two garage corners, and parging around the house.Jamie recommended a perfect solution for the wall on the side of our front steps where bricks had deteriorated faster than in other places. He suggested replacing the bricks with concrete blocks so we would not need to keep repairing this area. We liked this idea and Jamie placed the blocks so they repeat a step pattern and it looks very good. All work was done on time and the price was very reasonable. JMac Masonry will definitely be our first choice if we will need help with any masonry issues in the future.

  content: Jamie MacCormack and his team are true professionals in masonry restoration. From the time that I met Mr. MacCormack, he gave me the impression of being a person of his word. He quickly attended to inspect my deteriorated chimney, identified the type of brick that was used 25 years ago when the home was built and provided an estimate and schedule of what he would do and when. Mr. MacCormack followed up with me on when he would be starting the proposed brick chimney restoration work and then showed up as promised. The chimney restoration work was done in a good workmanlike manner with all the mortar joint thicknesses of equal size and similar colour to what existed. At the end of the restoration work, the site was cleared of all debris and sweep clean, something that is rarely done. I recommend Mr. MacCormack and his team of masonry restorers without any hesitation.

  content: Jamie Mac Cormack was observant about the poor condition of our street sign. I knew of the condition as well, but wasnâ€™t sure of where to go or the next step to take. Jamie and myself set-up a meeting to discuss what would be required to rebuild our clock/street sign and to give me years of continued use. It was a positive meeting. It would require a tear down of the side walls, rebuild a proper foundation and properly cap etc.. I thought matching the brick, from thirty years ago, would be a concern. The size of the brick as well. Jamie, took time and found a close match, that I was impressed.
    I can tell from the work he and his assistant do, that each project they take on, is important and special. While they were doing the work, I went out a number of times to chat and observe. Clean, neat and tidy.
    Three important points; Jamie held to his quote, Jamie held to his promise to complete this project before the cold weather and due to the nature of our business, was always respectful to the public coming and going.
    Without a doubt, in every aspect, I would highly recommend Jmac Masonry.
